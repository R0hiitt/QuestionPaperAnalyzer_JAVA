# Question Paper Analyzer

## 1. Project Overview

Question Paper Analyzer is a Java-based backend application designed to analyze previous years' examination question papers.

The application allows users to upload PDF question papers, extract their text, identify individual questions, and store the extracted information in MongoDB.

It also provides analytical insights such as marks distribution, year-wise question analysis, repeated questions, and question frequency.

## 2. Technologies Used

- Java 25
- Spring Boot 4.1.2
- MongoDB
- Spring Data MongoDB
- Apache PDFBox
- Maven
- Postman

## 3. Key Features

1. Subject Management – Add and retrieve subjects.
2. PDF Upload – Upload question papers in PDF format.
3. Text Extraction – Extract text from uploaded PDFs.
4. Question Extraction – Identify and store individual questions.
5. Duplicate Prevention – Prevent duplicate question entries during repeated extraction of the same paper.
6. Marks Distribution – Analyze questions according to their marks.
7. Year-wise Analysis – Analyze question papers and extracted questions across examination years.
8. Repeated Question Analysis – Identify questions appearing across multiple papers.
9. Question Frequency – Calculate how frequently questions appear across different papers.
